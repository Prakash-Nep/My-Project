                President Donald Trump imposed new tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China in 2025, citing border security and fentanyl concerns. The moves triggered retaliation from Canada and Mexico, disrupted trade negotiations, and raised consumer prices. Over 85% of trade remains tariff-free under USMCA exemptions.
